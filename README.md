# Ocean Floor Contour Prediction with Deep Learning
### This project was completed in a team of 3 as the final project for ECE 228: Machine Learning for Physical Applications.

__Abstract:__
The ocean floor is a complex and ever-changing landscape that is difficult to
explore due to the high pressure and darkness of the deep sea. Mapping the
ocean floor is crucial for various applications such as navigation, marine resources
management, and predicting natural hazards. Traditional methods of ocean floor
mapping involve expensive and time-consuming ship-borne surveys, which can
only cover a small portion of the ocean floor. In this paper, we explore machine
learning models for predicting ocean floor contours. Using data from the NOAA
National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) website, we compare
linear regression, convolutional neural network (CNN), pre-trained U-Net, and
conditional deep convolutional generative adversarial network (DCGAN) models
using mean squared error and structural similarity metrics. While most of the
models produce highly noisy results, the pre-trained U-Net model achieves great
performance, accurately predicting contours and offering potential cost and time
savings in seafloor mapping.
